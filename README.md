# FNFBot
FNFBot is a [FridayNightFunkin](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin) bot that plays charts pretty good.

I simply did this just because I thought it would be fun.

# WHAT ARE THESE ARROWS IN THE CONSOLE?

These arrows are what the program see's (sometimes notes dont show up but its more or less what it is)

The arrows are, well. Arrows of course.
`H` repersents a note that must be held.

# PC Requirements
Yes, this has PC Requirements because some people have a machine that was born in an oven at 365°F and loaded to perfection.

But seriously your pc should at least have:

**8gb+ of ram**

**Windows 10, or a linux distro with mono/wine**

**A good cpu, at least a i5 6th generation+ (and what ever that is in amd terms)**

# Usage
To use it, go to the [latest release](https://github.com/KadeDev/FNFBot/releases/latest) and download it.

Run the program and input your friday night funkin game folder (you need to have the data files for the charts, but you can still play it in the browser as well. You just need a download, so like why would you need to play in the browser?????? idk)

Then input the song name in all lowercase, and then the difficulty (hard or easy)

Go into FNF and play the song, when it says "GO" press F1 a bit after that.
Then watch the bot play the song.

# Other keybinds
F1 - Play

F2 - Stop playing

F3 - Add by 1 to the offset (milliseconds between keypresses)

F4 - Remove by 1 to the offset (milliseconds between keypresses)

# Problems
So, obviously its not perfect.
Here are the issues:

- Sometimes it just doesn't hit notes????

# Credits
I used [rqnn's global C# keyboard hook](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46014022) and [Micheal Noonan's Input Simulator](https://github.com/michaelnoonan/inputsimulator) for input and output.

I also now use [memory.dll](https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll) for hooking into the game

Go give them love.
