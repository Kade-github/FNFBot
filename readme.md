# FNFBot Rewrite
## The better version of FNFBot

### WARNING!

If FNFBot doesn't hit notes perfectly, don't worry, as it doesn't know where to start automatically. You have to press F1 at the right time. So don't create issues telling us that it "hits notes early" or whatever.

## 6K/9K will NOT be added, stop asking for it ##

### How do I use FNFBot?

FNFBot has 3 main sections, as shown here:


![3Sections](https://i.imgur.com/fwlUZPg.png)


The **red** section is where you enter all the data like the game's directory on your computer.


The **green** area is the console, this outputs useful information.

Examples:

- What happened when you pressed a keybind
- What notes the bot's planning on hitting
- When the bot completes a song

The **blue** section is where the bot renders the notes that are *probably* there, including the length of held notes.

### Keybinds
FNFBot currently has 3 keybinds, and in the future it will have modifyable keybinds.

Currently the keybinds are as follows:

| Keybind      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| F1      | Start/Stop Playing the selected map       |
| F2   | Increase the offset        |
| F3   | Decrease the offset        |


Offset = the amount of time in miliseconds to hit before/after the note time.
Default: 25

### How To Start
Press F1 When "Go!" Fades.
